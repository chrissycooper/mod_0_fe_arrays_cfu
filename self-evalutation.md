## Self Evaluation
- I feel confident with arrays at this time. I have had some exposure to them before which was easy to add on to and grow. 
- I don't think I'll need additional learning before the next lesson. 
- is there a limit to the number of elements you can add to an array? I wonder which and how many methods are used the most often.
